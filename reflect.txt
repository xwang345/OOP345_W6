I feel the most comfortable lambda can be used directly with the local temporary variables, write their own function what the transfer will be very troublesome. In particular, when writing multi-threaded, there are variables to capture the words are very simple, not the whole global variables, do not have their own definition of the structure of the pointer.

This week due to the impact of school strikes led to my workshop6 of the above problems can not be resolved immediately so I delayed submitted workshop6, I hope you can understand. In addition, I handed over my quiz6 by email, because during in the quiz my laptop is in blue screen, so I can't give my quiz by blackboard at that times I submitted by email, but I may thought you have not checked yet, I am through this email address(xwang345@myseneca.ca) sent to you the quiz6, I hope you can check.

Thank you
